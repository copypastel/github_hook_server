notes on the sendmail hook
==========================
I considered various options for sending email.  Since I use Gmail and
wanted to keep the code as slim as possible, I chose at this stage to
opt for the path of least resistance and let the system MTA deal with
it.  I use Postfix, which can be easily configured to relay through
the Gmail SMTP servers using this tutorial:

I use Debian, and it worked perfectly for me.
